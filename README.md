# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

About Me:
Hi, my name is Enes Bayramli, I'm a sophomore at Leigh High School. I've been coding for a couple years and I mostly coded in JavaScript and python, but i've been wanting to get into AI for a while and wanted a good way to learn it on top of school.

Goals for this Course:
I want to learn a lot more about AI and be able to create my own.
I also want to further improve my Python skills to a point of fluency
